                <p class="intro">Let's cut to the chase: we will no longer continue updating MSlolcat. We have stopped updating the script but you can still use it, but, no more updates will come meaning future updates will not get patches.</p>
                <p class="content">
                    As important MSlolcat was for the growth and credence of our stuff, it became clear that we must expand our horizons and move on. In light of this new direction, we have decided to sunset MSlolcat and begin work on more ambitious projects. We are currently working on many very exciting things, which we hope to showcase soon.

                    We want to thank our users for their support. It really has been a pleasure to serve you all. We are thrilled about what the future holds for us, and we hope that you will continue to follow our journey.
                </p>
